        <h1>About Valentine's Day</h1>
        <p class="lead">Source: <i>Wikipedia.org</i></p>
        <p class="lead">Valentine's Day,
            also called Saint Valentine's Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine,
            is celebrated annually on February 14.<br>
            Originating as a Western Christian feast day honoring one or two early saints named Valentinus,
            Valentine's Day is recognized as a significant cultural,
            religious, and commercial celebration of romance and romantic love in many regions around the world,
            although it is not a public holiday in any country.</p>
        <img src="images/img2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Image">
        <p>Martyrdom stories associated with various Valentines connected to February 14 are presented in martyrologies,
            including a written account of Saint Valentine of Rome's imprisonment for performing weddings for soldiers,
            who were forbidden to marry, and for ministering to Christians persecuted under the Roman Empire.<br>
            According to legend, during his imprisonment Saint Valentine restored sight to the blind daughter of his judge,
            and before his execution he wrote her a letter signed "Your Valentine" as a farewell.</p>
        <p>The day first became associated with romantic love within the circle of Geoffrey Chaucer in the 14th century,
            when the tradition of courtly love flourished.<br>
            In 18th-century England, it evolved into an occasion in which lovers expressed their love for each other by presenting flowers,
            offering confectionery, and sending greeting cards (known as "valentines").<br>
            In Europe, Saint Valentine's Keys are given to lovers "as a romantic symbol and an invitation to unlock the giverâ€™s heart",
            as well as to children, in order to ward off epilepsy (called Saint Valentine's Malady).<br>
            Valentine's Day symbols that are used today include the heart-shaped outline,
            doves, and the figure of the winged Cupid.<br>
            Since the 19th century, handwritten valentines have given way to mass-produced greeting cards.</p>
        <p>Saint Valentine's Day is an official feast day in the Anglican Communion and the Lutheran Church.<br>
            Many parts of the Eastern Orthodox Church also celebrate Saint Valentine's Day, albeit on July 6 and July 30,
            the former date in honor of the Roman presbyter Saint Valentine,
            and the latter date in honor of Hieromartyr Valentine, the Bishop of Interamna (modern Terni).</p>
